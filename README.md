## DISCOVER THE WORLD OF ALGORITHM

### Background
I have participate in a bootcamp with [Big-O Coding](https://bigocoding.com/), start from 25th March 2024. This is the journal of my adventure exploring data-structures and algorithms. The theory part, which includes definition, principle and usage is provided by Big-O Coding and practice exercise from popular programming platform such as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [CodeForce](https://codeforces.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

### Topics
Here are topics that has been covered through out the bootcamp.
1. Dynamic Array and String
2. Algorithmic Complexity
3. Sorting Algorithms
4. Stack and Queue
5. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
6. Depth-First Search (DFS)
7. Heap
8. Dikstra Algorithm
9. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
10. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
11. Binary Search
12. Binary Search Tree
13. Trie
14. Prim
15. Disjoint Set Union
